Setup Instructions

1) Move all controller switches up and make sure that the throttle (up/down for left lever) is all the way down
2) Turn on the controller
3) Ensure that someone else is holding the subscale aircraft with nothing away from the propeller, this ensures that if the propeller accidentally moves, it does not touch anything
4) Plug in both the 11.1V and 9V batteries in the plane, make sure that both are sufficiently charged for the flight
5) There should be 4 beeps, if there are more, make sure the throttle is all the way down, unplug the plane and start again from step 3
6) Attach the cockpit cover to the plane
7) Plane should be ready to fly, check that all flight surfaces and propeller are working


Flight Instructions
IMPORTANT NOTES: 
* The propeller in a 12 or 6 o'clock position is taller than the rest of the aircraft. For this reason DO NOT ATTEMPT to takeoff from the ground. When landing ENSURE that the propeller is in a position where it will not hit anything on landing.
* The aircraft is currently susceptible to wind-related loss-of-control. Fly the aircraft in an space where there is no wind.


1) Check that the cockpit cover is attached to the plane and that all flight surfaces and the propeller are working
2) Have one person hold the aircraft by the fuselage and another person control it
3) Turn the plane throttle to 100% while the aircraft is still being held
4) While the throttle is at 100%, gently throw the aircraft forward at an upward angle
5) Aircraft is now in flight

Battery information
* Servos are powered by a 9V Alkaline Battery
* Rest of the aircraft uses a rechargeable 11.1V LiPo battery
